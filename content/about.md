Hello! 

I am Ricardo, a long-time developer who start with back-end, then moved to iOS (when that was still iPhone OS), then again to back-end and once again to iOS. Now trying to unify both worlds and to convince back-end developers to know more about mobile and mobile developers to know more back-end.

Want to make suggestions of themes, corrections or discuss something? Do it in the [repository of the blog](https://github.com/rabc/rabc_blog).

You can find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/rabc).
